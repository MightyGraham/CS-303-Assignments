# CS-303-Assignments

It has been a while since I last used GitHub so hopefully I am doing this correct

There are 2 source files (.cpp) and 1 header file (.h) that are needed in order for this code to work, and the text file. (or you can download the entire folder)
and the code just runs itself 

I will admit that I did use chatgpt for the A1input.cpp file as I struggled a bit figuring out how to code each of those functions


Here are the screenshots of the outputs

Final output:
